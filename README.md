# PiDS-TH25
Raspberry Pi, Intrusion Detection System and Threat Hunter

Using a Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi 4, Model B from CanaKit), configuring and adding enhancements to create a fully functional NIDS and threat hunter. Pre-requisites to begin the project include a Raspberry Pi, 256GB storage (external MicroSD), 8GB RAM, and WiFi adapter. The setup is headless and meant to be able to connect to via SSH from any device on the network. Reconfigure LAN settings if moving to another network. 

For NIDS, using Suricata. This part of the README will continuously update as the project develops.
